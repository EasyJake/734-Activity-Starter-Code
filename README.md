We can see our starter code on this repl:

Let's break down the components that we have in this app:

The App parent component has some introductory text and it imports in the UserInterface component that houses the most important components in our app.
The UserInterface component imports two components, CollectorButton (one of the components that we must pass data to through Context) and SubmitForm
The SubmitForm component uses Context to modify the styling and display of the app's features.
